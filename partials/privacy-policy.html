<h3>1. Who We Are</h3>
<p>Visible Legal Marketing Limited (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a claims management company regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA No. 835293).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Company number: 10263322</li>
  <li>Registered address: 5 Eagle Fold, Hyde, England, SK14 4GU</li>
  <li>Contact: <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Controller:</strong> For the purposes of UK data protection law, Visible Legal Marketing Limited is the data controller of your personal data. We do not appoint a mandatory Data Protection Officer, but you can contact our <strong>Data Protection Lead</strong> at <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Purpose of This Policy</h3>
<p>This policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal information when you use our IVA Claim Checker, sign a Letter of Authority (LOA), upload documents, or otherwise contact us.</p>

<h3>3. The Data We Collect</h3>
<p>We may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contact details (name, email, phone)</li>
  <li>IVA details (provider, reference number, status, debt level, monthly payment, IVA type)</li>
  <li>Address &amp; residency information (current/previous address, residential status)</li>
  <li>Employment &amp; income details (employment status, job title, salary)</li>
  <li>Supporting documents you upload (e.g., IVA letters, statements)</li>
  <li>LOA status and the signed LOA PDF</li>
  <li>Marketing source and consent preferences</li>
  <li>Interaction logs (e.g., “LOA Sent/View/Signed”, “DSAR Sent/Received”, and contact events)</li>
  <li>Technical data from essential cookies; analytics cookies only with consent (see Cookies)</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. How We Collect Your Data</h3>
<p>Directly from you (our forms, email, SMS/WhatsApp, phone). We also receive updates from our SRA-regulated solicitor partners in relation to your claim and from your IVA provider when fulfilling DSARs you authorise.</p>

<h3>5. How We Use Your Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assess your potential IVA mis-selling claim</li>
  <li>Generate and send your LOA for e-signature</li>
  <li>Provide you a secure link to upload supporting documents (optional)</li>
  <li><strong>Securely obtain your DSAR from your IVA provider</strong> (using your LOA) and share the DSAR pack with our panel solicitors to review and progress your claim</li>
  <li>Communicate with you about your case via email and, where applicable, SMS/WhatsApp</li>
  <li>Maintain compliance and audit logs</li>
  <li>Improve our services and website (analytics only with consent)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Automated steps:</em> certain steps (e.g., sending the LOA, issuing document-upload links, logging status changes, and routing data to our systems) are automated. We do not carry out automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects.</p>
<p><em>Controller roles:</em> We act as the controller for our processing activities. Once your data (including the DSAR pack we secure) is shared with a panel solicitor, that firm acts as an <strong>independent controller</strong> for its legal services.</p>

<h3>6. Lawful Basis</h3>
<p>Our primary basis is <strong>consent</strong> (UK GDPR Art. 6(1)(a)) for claim assessment, contacting you, securing DSARs, and sharing information with panel solicitors. We may also rely on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)) for fraud prevention, security, service improvement, and maintaining audit logs (balanced against your rights)</li>
  <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> (Art. 6(1)(c)) to meet regulatory and record-keeping requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>You can withdraw consent at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a>. Withdrawal does not affect prior processing.</p>
<p>Where you choose to provide information about health or other vulnerability (special-category data), we process it only with your <strong>explicit consent</strong> (UK GDPR Art. 9(2)(a)) to help ensure appropriate handling of your claim.</p>

<h3>7. Sharing Your Data</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Panel solicitors (SRA-regulated):</strong> we share your case details and the DSAR pack we secure to review and progress your claim.</li>
  <li><strong>Service providers (processors):</strong> we use reputable vendors for secure processing, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Airtable (case records and interaction logs)</li>
      <li>eSignatures.io (LOA e-signature and signed LOA PDFs)</li>
      <li>Dropbox (secure file requests and document storage)</li>
      <li>Make (automation/orchestration between systems)</li>
      <li>Email/SMS/WhatsApp providers as needed to contact you</li>
    </ul>
    These providers act under our instructions and we have appropriate data processing agreements in place.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Regulators or authorities:</strong> where required by law (e.g., FCA, ICO).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data.</p>

<h3>7A. Children</h3>
<p>Our services are intended for adults (18+). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

<h3>8. Retention</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Form-only enquiries without LOA or continued consent:</strong> retained for up to <strong>90 days</strong> for follow-up and then deleted or anonymised, unless we are required to keep them longer (e.g., to resolve a complaint).</li>
  <li><strong>Active claims (with LOA and DSAR/solicitor referral):</strong> retained for up to <strong>6 years</strong> after closure to meet regulatory and record-keeping requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We retain cookie consent records for up to <strong>12 months</strong>. We review our retention periods regularly and may retain data longer where required by law or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</p>

<h3>9. Your Rights</h3>
<p>You have rights to access, rectification, erasure, restriction/objection, and data portability. To exercise them or to withdraw consent, email <a href="mailto:support@visiblelegal.co.uk">support@visiblelegal.co.uk</a>. We may ask you to verify your identity.</p>
<p>We aim to respond to rights requests within <strong>one month</strong> of receipt (extendable by two months for complex requests). You are not required to provide personal data, but without certain details (e.g., a signed LOA) we cannot secure a DSAR or progress a claim.</p>

<h3>10. Data Security</h3>
<p>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your data against unauthorised access, loss, or misuse (including encryption in transit, access controls, and audit logging).</p>

<h3>11. International Transfers</h3>
<p>Some service providers may process data outside the UK. Where this occurs, we implement appropriate safeguards such as the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) and/or Standard Contractual Clauses, and rely on adequacy regulations where available.</p>

<h3>12. Cookies</h3>
<p>We use essential cookies to operate the site. We may also use analytics and marketing cookies (e.g., GA4/Meta) <strong>only with your consent</strong>. You can manage preferences via our cookie banner. See our <a href="/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a> for details.</p>
<p>Analytics and marketing technologies are <strong>not loaded</strong> until you consent, and you can change your choice at any time via “Change cookie settings”.</p>

<h3>13. Communications Preferences</h3>
<p>We may contact you about your claim via email and, where you provide a number and consent, via SMS/WhatsApp. You can opt out at any time by replying STOP (for SMS/WhatsApp) or using the unsubscribe option in emails, or by contacting us.</p>
